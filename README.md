# Portfolio-
 
For this project I created a personal portfolio which includes: 
1. My Name
2. Recent Photo
3. A section about me, my work, and contact info
4. A Navigation section
5. Links to featured work.

I have included both: 

* The URL of the deployed application:

https://stevenmoseni.github.io/Portfolio-/.

* The URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code. Give the repository a unique name and include a README file that describes the project.

https://github.com/StevenMoseni/Portfolio-
